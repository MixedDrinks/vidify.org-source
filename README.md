# Vidify's website
This website contains the source code for [vidify.org](https://vidify.org/).

It's a static site generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and based on the [Navigator Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/navigator-hugo/).

## Building
You can build the website with `hugo -D`. All the static files will be saved into the `public/` directory. If you want to use live-reload, you can use `hugo server -D` and open [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).
