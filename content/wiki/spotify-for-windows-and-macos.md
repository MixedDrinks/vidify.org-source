This is the default API for Windows and Mac OS users. The API uses the [SwSpotify](https://github.com/SwagLyrics/SwSpotify) library to obtain information from the desktop Spotify apps for both Windows and Mac OS. You don't have to install any dependencies, since it's already installed by default on these platforms.

Mac OS usage hasn't been tested because their emulators are really limited. If you're having issues, please open an [issue](https://github.com/vidify/vidify) with detailed information.

*Note: this API works with Linux too, but the [Spotify for Linux](https://github.com/vidify/vidify/wiki/Spotify-for-Linux) API is better in most cases, so it's disabled.*
